Hello,

I am a self-taught programmer. Just a newbie yet, but I trying to improve my skills. Here is one of my project. Just a simple Lotto Game (populat lottery in Poland).

You can generate every lottery game you want: you can perform as many singles draws as you want. Also you can tell the machine how many numbers it should pick and how much possibiles "choices" it has.

Application has no GUI, it just console output application. 
It is all about the algorithm of making lottery.
